Science Fair Project Code for 2025



This project has a few files:



simulationfaster.py is in charge of simulating all the games

RunCode.py is to run simulation.py on a separate window

stats.py is to analyze the data and return graphs

1-46.py is where all the raw data for the games are stored




I know the coding is not the most efficient, but it gets the job done. The files might also be messed up in the code because of many repetitions of renaming files.
